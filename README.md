# üëÅÔ∏è Real-time Human and Object Detection System (YOLOv8 Optimized)

A high-performance computer vision system developed for real-time human and object detection. This project successfully optimized the model architecture to significantly boost detection accuracy and speed, making it suitable for security, monitoring, and industrial applications.

## üéØ Impact & Achievements

* **Accuracy Enhancement:** Achieved a **10 percent increase in detection accuracy** by leveraging the advanced architecture of **YOLOv8** over previous models.
* **Real-time Performance:** Model performance was **optimized for fast and accurate detections**, critical for integration into live video streams and low-latency environments.
* **Real-World POC:** Successfully developed a Proof-of-Concept (POC) model for the Indian Railway to detect the presence of safety measures and signals while barriers are open, triggering an alarm if absent (demonstrating practical application).
